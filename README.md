# This a simple ReactJS translator app that lets you find out the chinese caracter that matches the word that you wrote.

# It uses REACTJS in the frontend, as well as Tailwind and DaisyUI as CSS Frameworks. This one doesnt have backend but uses Axios to fetch the data from the API

# For the language traslation I used Microsoft Translator Text API available at Rapidapi.com.

# Hope you enjoy!
